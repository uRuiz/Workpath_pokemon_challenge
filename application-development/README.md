# Application Development

Create a small application to buy Pokemons using the public Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/).

The application should contain:
- An overview page (listing a small set of Pokemon)
- A checkout page (where the cart can be modified by changing the count of individual items and remove them)
- A minicart on the top right which shows the count of all Pokemons in cart. (i.e 2 Pikachu, 1 Bulbasaur = 3)
- Test are only necessary for mid-level applicants

## Task Details
- You don't need to be pixel perfect.
- Responsive not necessary.
- Use your imagination to make buttons, links, etc. nice to use and understand.
- For data fetching use `fetch`.
- Think about loading states (i.e network request loading) and implement them as well.
- The endpoint ``https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon` does not provide all details necessary to create the initial data. Find a way to fetch all data necessary.
- For the price please use `base_experience` which you can get from `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/<pokemonName>`.
