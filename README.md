# Welcome to the Frontend Developer Take Home Assignment

Welcome to the repository for the Frontend Developer take home assignment. This take home assignment is to test your:

- Understanding of JavaScript and basics of React development
- Understanding of React ecosystem
- Ability to create maintainable and well written code


## What to expect
The biggest part of this assignment is the `application-development` task. Expect to spend around 3-4 hours. We know this is quite a commitment. However to show you our appreciation and commitment to feedback culture we will give you:

- complete feedback on all your pull requests.
- an 1 hour call to discuss the take home assignment but also your questions related to feedback.


## Tasks
Please read the instructions carefully:

- Each folder contains a task.
- For each task create one PR.
- Make each PR as easy as possible to review (i.e good commit message standards, PR descriptions and details). 
- Treat each PR as you would treat a real application. Only commit code which is actually used and absolutely necessary for each PR.
- If you use code snippets (i.e. from Stack Overflow) please include references.
- Use 2 space indentation.

## Hints

- Each task can be solved in multiple ways, there is no right or wrong.
- When in doubt, go for the simplest and most straightforward solution which uses the least amount of code.
- Feel free to use any feature available, i.e. issues, comments, projects.
- Feel free to add any tooling (eslint, prettier) neccessary to the project.

If you have any questions just ping me here.

Have fun!
