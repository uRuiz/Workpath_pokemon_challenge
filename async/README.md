# Async Code

In the file `api.js` you will find two libraries which mock an API:

- `dbFakeUserRequest` returns a `name` string and a `roles` array for any given `userId`.
- Using the response from `dbFakeUserRequest`, `dbFakeRoleRequest` returns the role name for any `roleId`

Write an application which returns a user's name and his roles
